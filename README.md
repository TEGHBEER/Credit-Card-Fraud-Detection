## Introduction
In an era where digital transactions have become the cornerstone of daily commerce, the security of these transactions is paramount. Credit card fraud is a pressing concern, costing businesses and consumers billions of dollars annually. This project aims to develop a sophisticated credit card fraud detection system using advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions in real-time.

### Objectives of the Project
- Enhancing the accuracy of fraud detection models.
- Reducing false positives to avoid inconveniencing customers.
- Establishing a system that can adapt to emerging fraud patterns.

### Significance of the Study
This study serves as a critical investigation into the effectiveness of predictive analytics in the domain of fraud detection. By leveraging historical transaction data and identifying patterns indicative of fraud, we can preemptively flag and review suspicious activities.

## Business Problem
The proliferation of credit card fraud is a critical issue for European banks, threatening substantial financial losses and eroding the trust of cardholders. This report examines how machine learning tools are implemented to secure the integrity of credit card transactions for European cardholders and safeguard the fiscal health and trustworthiness of the banking sector.

### Current Limitations of Existing Fraud Detection Systems
1. **False Positives**: Existing systems frequently produce false positives, marking legal transactions as fraudulent.
2. **Delayed Detection**: Some systems have latency problems, allowing fraudulent transactions to go undetected.
3. **Lack of Scalability**: Traditional techniques find it difficult to grow with rising transaction volumes.
4. **Complex Fraud Patterns**: It's challenging for systems to stay up to date with the latest trends in fraud.

## Proposed Solution
Our project introduces an advanced credit card fraud detection system tailored to European financial ecosystems, using transaction data from 2013. This system is engineered to mitigate the limitations of current detection methods by deploying cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

### Key Components
- **Innovative Algorithms**: A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Designed for real-time analysis, providing immediate alerts on suspicious transactions.
- **Adaptability**: Continuous learning mechanisms to adapt to evolving fraudulent tactics.
- **Interpretability**: Employing SHAP values for transparent model predictions.

## Differentiation from Existing Solutions
- **User-Friendly Interface and Transparency**: Prioritizing user involvement through a friendly interface.
- **Comprehensive Fraud Detection and Data Privacy**: PCA transformation for data confidentiality and fraud detection.

## Dataset Details
- **Dataset**: Credit card transactions by European cardholders in 2013
- **Size**: Over 284,807 records
- **Data Format**: Tabular format with rows representing transactions
- **Features**:
  - Time
  - Anonymized attributes (V1-V28)
  - Transaction amount
  - Fraud indicator (Class)
- **Null Values**: No null values present in the dataset

## Steps Implemented in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the dataset
   - Handling missing values (No null values present)
   - Feature scaling 

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Feature scaling
   - Feature Transformation

3. **Dataset Balancing**:
   - Using ADASYN and SMOTE for dataset balancing to address class imbalance

4. **Model Implementation**:
   - Utilizing various machine learning models for fraud detection:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Naive Bayes
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost

5. **Comparing Models**:
   - Evaluating and comparing the performance of different models
   - Metrics used: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

6. **Creating the Interface**:
   - Developing a user-friendly interface using Streamlit
   - Input: User provides transaction details
   - Output: Prediction on whether the transaction is fraudulent or not
   - Displaying features contributing to the prediction
   - Providing recommendations to improve the chances of approval if the transaction is predicted as fraudulent

## Result Summary
The project presents the methodology applied in building the fraud detection model, including data acquisition, preprocessing, feature selection, model implementation, and model comparison. It also includes the interpretation of feature importance using SHAP values and recommendations for implementation. The user-friendly interface allows users to input their transaction information and receive instant feedback on whether the transaction is likely to be fraudulent. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance detection rates, reduce false positives, and adapt to evolving fraud patterns, ultimately contributing to a safer financial environment.
